# PRACTICE_3
This final practice was made by Martin Quijano Hoyos and Sofia Marin Bustamante.

The code consists in a compiler-type program that checks the syntax of a FEN string provided by the user. 
In case that the syntax is correct, the program will display a graphical interface showing the corresponding Chessboard of the FEN string given. If there is a mistake in the String, our compiler identifies the type of mistake and specifies it, allowing the user to correct it and continue with the program until the Chessborad is completed correctly and displayed.

For the correct operation of the code is a must to have a directory, in a specific location, with the png images of the Chess pieces. 
That directory will be included in this repository, with and additional image that shows the location of it in the project.
